I have user json placeholder api so anyone can you that without installing any package
I use redux for the state management
On every json server only few records are there so I am not able to show the 100 reocords, with the same json structure mentiond in test
And regrading the filteration the json placeholder dont have option for key letter filteration so I just filtered the records according to the avaliability
